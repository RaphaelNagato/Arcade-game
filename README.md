## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

##Game-Instructions

* Download or clone the git file, then open the `index.html` and run it on your browser to play
* Use the keyboard Arrow keys to move the player to the other side
* In the case of a collision with the bugs or a case of a "win", the game resets.

##Dependencies

* The collosion algorithm was taken from the Mozilla Developer Site
* Michael Cranford's blog was consulted for a walk-through
* `engine.js` and `resources.js` consists of functions that the `app.js` depends on
